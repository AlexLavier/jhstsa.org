# Music Production

Participants produce an original musical piece designed
to be played during the closing session of the national TSA
conference. The quality of the musical piece and required
documentation (including elements such as a plan of work,
self-evaluation, and a list of hardware, software, and instruments used) determines advancement to the semifinal level
of competition, during which semifinalist participants are
interviewed.
