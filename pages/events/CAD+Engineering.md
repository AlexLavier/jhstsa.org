# Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Engineering

Participants use complex computer graphic skills, tools, and
processes to respond to a design challenge in which they
develop three-dimensional representations of engineering
subjects, such as a machine part, tool, device, or manufactured
product. The solution to the design challenge and participant
answers in an interview are evaluated.
