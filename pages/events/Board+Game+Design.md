# Board Game Design

Participants develop, build, and package a board game that
focuses on a subject of their choice. Creative packaging, and
the instructions, pieces, and cards associated with the pilot
game will be evaluated. Semifinalists set up the game, demonstrate how the game is played, explain the gameâ€™s features, and
discuss the design process.
