# Audio Podcasting

Participants use digital audio technology to create original
content for a podcast piece that addresses the annual theme.
The podcast must feature high level storytelling techniques,
voice acting, and folly sound effects; the full entry must include
documentation of the podcast development process and
elements. Semifinalists participate in an interview.
