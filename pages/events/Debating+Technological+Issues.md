# Debating Technological Issues

Participants research the annual topic and subtopics and
prepare for a debate against a team from another chapter.
Teams are instructed to take either the pro or con side of a
selected subtopic, submit a summary of references, and use
their research to support their assigned position. The quality of
a teamâ€™s debate determines semifinalists and finalists.
