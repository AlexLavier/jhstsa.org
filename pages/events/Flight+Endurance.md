# Flight Endurance

Participants design, build, fly, and adjust (trim) a rubber-band
powered model aircraft to make long endurance flights inside
a contained airspace. Documentation (including elements
such as attributes of the model design, drawings, and an analysis of the trim modifications), an inspection of the model and
the required model flight box, and official times for two flights
are aspects of the evaluation.
