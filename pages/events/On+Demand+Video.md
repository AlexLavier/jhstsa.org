# On Demand Video

Once participants receive the challenge details (required
criteria, such as props and a line of dialogue) at the national
TSA conference, they have 36 hours to produce a 60-second
film that showcases video skills, tools, and communication
processes. The quality of the completed video production
determines the finalists.
