# Fashion Design and Technology

To address the annual theme, participants demonstrate
expertise in fashion design principles by creating a wearable
garment, garment patterns, and a documentation portfolio.
Semifinalist teams present their garment designs (worn by
team models), discuss the design process with evaluators, and
respond to interview questions.
