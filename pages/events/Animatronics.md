# Animatronics

To address the annual design challenge, participants exhibit
and demonstrate their knowledge of mechanical and control
systems by creating an animatronic device with a specific
purpose (i.e., communicate an idea, entertain, demonstrate a
concept, etc.) that includes sound, lights, and an appropriate
surrounding environment (a display).
