# Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Architecture

Participants use complex computer graphic skills, tools, and
processes to respond to a design challenge in which they
develop representations of architectural subjects, such as
foundation and/or floor plans, and/or elevation drawings, and/
or details of architectural ornamentation or cabinetry. The
solution to the design challenge and participant answers in an
interview are evaluated.
